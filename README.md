Reimplement Twitter.com
======================

-------------------------

The goal of this exercise is to test your front-end skills. Don't worry about the backend at all. You are expected to produce only HTML, CSS and JS files. Do not build a Sinatra application. The resulting file should be as close to the real Twitter feed page as possible.
